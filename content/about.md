I’m Alex Danvy, a French geek, father of a little ninja and a graceful princess, passionate about software, computers and entrepreneurship. Expect to read some technical stuff but not limited to. I might talk about food or way of life (Hey, I’m French after all). I plan to write most articles in English to share with the broadest audience and train my English (I’ll do my best to respect the English language). All opinions are mine.

I spent 2 years in a “2 guys” IT company, 15 years working at [EBP](https://ebp.com) mainly in the development team, 11 years at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) as an evangelist (Development tools, cloud and Internet of Things) and now entrepreneur at [Altoviz](https://altoviz.com) making an awesome invoicing and accouting app for small businesses and freelancers.

I’ve been a speaker at numerous events in France, US, Canada and North Africa (up to 3500 attendees). I will speak freely but don’t expect to find trolls or bashing about anybody/anything here. I love to share my enthusiasm and improvement ideas. It’s often easier to break than to build. I’m a builder. It’s easier criticize than to create. I’m a creator.

I will be thankful if you give me some feedback through comments about the content and/or the form of articles you read here.

Feel free to share your love and my articles.

Thanks.

Alex
